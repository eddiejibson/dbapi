## Enable the PDO driver

As this database API uses PDO, it must be enabled first. To do so, comment out the following within your `php.ini` file.

So that's uncommenting

  

	;extension=php_pdo_mysql.dll

  

To

  

	extension=php_pdo_mysql.dll

## Security

This API takes advantage of prepared statements. This can prevent nasty attacks such as SQL injections. A demonstration of how to use such can be found within the [example](https://gitlab.com/eddiejibson/dbapi/blob/master/example.php)
